# Fantasy Premier League Analytics

The goal of this repository is to create a web application with better statistics on player and team performance than the original website: http://draft.premierleague.com/

I will start by getting the data I will need. This will be in two files since we are halfway through the season, one which gets the data from previous gameweeks and one which will run periodically and scrape current gameweek data
