# Fantasy Premier League Analytics

The goal of this repository is to create a web application with better statistics on player and team performance within my league than the original website: http://draft.premierleague.com/. By changing the league ids this can of course be replicated for anyone's league.

I will start by getting the data I will need. This will be in two files since we are halfway through the season, one which gets the data from previous gameweeks and one which will run periodically and scrape current gameweek data
